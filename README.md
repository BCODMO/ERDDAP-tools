# ERDDAP-tools
BCO-DMO Tools for ERDDAP

Started with ooi_datasets_xml.py script at https://github.com/rsignell-usgs/notebook/tree/master/ERDDAP. 

Updated script and template for BCO-DMO usage.

[Update] This was never used in the operational implementation of ERDDAP at BCO-DMO. This was primarily for testing purposes.
